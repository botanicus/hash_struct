h1. About

@HashStruct@ is similar to @Struct@ from Ruby standard library, the difference is that @HashStruct.generate@ creates a class which takes a hash with attributes rather than just positional arguments as @Struct.new@ does.

The point is that this is behaviour which all the model have, so you can use @HashStruct@ to test thinks which expect something what quacks like a model class.

h1. Usage

<pre>
User  = HashStruct.generate(:first_name, :last_name)
@user = User.new(first_name: "Jakub", last_name: "Stastny")
</pre>

h1. Inheritance

<pre>
module TestMixin
  def say_hi() puts("Hi!") end
end

HashStruct.extend(TestMixin)
User = HashStruct.generate(:first_name, :last_name)
User.say_hi
# => "Hi!"
</pre>

<pre>
HashStruct.send(:include, TestMixin)
User = HashStruct.generate(:first_name, :last_name)
User.new.say_hi
# => "Hi!"
</pre>

You may want to create your custom class inhterited from @HashStruct@ in case you want to extend it.

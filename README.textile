h1. About

HashStruct is similar to Struct from Ruby standard library, the difference is that HashStruct.new creates a class which takes a hash with attributes rather than just positional arguments as Struct.new does.

The point is that this is behaviour which all the model have, so you can use HashStruct to test thinks which expect something what quacks like a model class.

h1. Usage

<pre>
User  = HashStruct.new(:first_name, :last_name)
@user = User.new(first_name: "Jakub", last_name: "Stastny")
</pre>

h1. Inheritance

<pre>
module TestMixin
  def say_hi() puts("Hi!") end
end

HashStruct.extend(TestMixin)
User = HashStruct.new(:first_name, :last_name)
User.say_hi
# => "Hi!"
</pre>

<pre>
HashStruct.send(:include, TestMixin)
User = HashStruct.new(:first_name, :last_name)
User.new.say_hi
# => "Hi!"
</pre>
